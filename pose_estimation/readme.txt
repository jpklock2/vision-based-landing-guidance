# Pose Estimation

It is possible to run the Pose Estimation module as a stand-alone module, with pre-defined or detected runway corner points.

This module is structured as follows:

```
pose_estimation
├── camera_calibration
│   ├── camera_matrix.pkl
|   └── distortion.pkl
├── pose_estimation.py
├── pose_estimation_utils.py
└── runway_data.csv
```
